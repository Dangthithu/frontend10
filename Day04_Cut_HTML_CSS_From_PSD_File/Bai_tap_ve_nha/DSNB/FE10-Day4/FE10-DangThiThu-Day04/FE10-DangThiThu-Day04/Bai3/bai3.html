				<p class="p">
					Since enjoyment needs to be your highest priority, you need to think about what you want out of the getaway. Do you love the roar of the waves and a salty ocean breeze? Consider a beach resort or a stay in a coastal town! Fancy a white-water adventure? Look for upriver experiences! Are you an explorer at heart? Traverse the city streets in picturesque little towns without many tourists. The options are endless, and the goal must be to pick a place that tugs at your heartstrings. Of course, there are more practical considerations too – you don’t want it to be so far away that you spend half the weekend in transit!
